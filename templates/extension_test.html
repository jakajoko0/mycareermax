                <h2>Director, Implementation & Technical Support</h2>
                <p><strong>Company:</strong> Skipify</p>
                <p><strong>Remote:</strong> No</p>
                <p><strong>Employment Type:</strong> FULLTIME</p>

                <h3>Description: Who we are</h3>
                <p>At Skipify, our mission is to eliminate friction in the shopper's journey while helping merchants
                    build even stronger
                    relationships with their customers. We are an early stage technology platform that is building the
                    next generation of
                    ubiquitous ecommerce infrastructure to bring the most efficient checkout experience to
                    shoppers-wherever, whenever they
                    want to make a purchase. We bridge the gap between financial institutions, ecommerce providers, and
                    merchants so
                    shoppers can simply enter their email and checkout instantly, with all their details pre-filled. The
                    challenge ahead is
                    unprecedented and oftentimes will find us having to define the opportunity for ourselves, as well as
                    the industry at
                    large. That means you have the unique latitude to roll up your sleeves and be a leading voice in
                    defining the vision
                    that drives the next generation of shopping experiences.</p>

                <h3>Who you'll be working with</h3>
                <p>At Skipify, we believe in a culture of autonomy, using values to take action. But autonomy doesn't
                    mean you're isolated.
                    Far from it. Our team focuses on collaboration and alignment, ensuring you have the resources at
                    your disposal to have
                    the most impact you can.

                    The Implementation and Technical Operations team at Skipify guides our partners, both internal and
                    external, through
                    every stage of our partner's implementation, from strategy and design to technical development and
                    launch. Skipify takes
                    both an advisory and a consultative role in helping our partners successfully execute against their
                    goals.</p>

                <h3>What you'll do</h3>
                <p>As the Director of Implementation, you will be responsible for developing and leading the
                    implementation and technical
                    operations team at Skipify. The team drives three key initiatives at Skipify: technical support,
                    both internal and
                    external; consulting and advising partners on their ideal integration strategy for success; and
                    executing against
                    internal and external go-live timelines.

                    As we continue to scale, we are looking for a hands-on leader to help build a collaborative
                    ecosystem where these
                    functions work collaboratively and seamlessly.</p>
